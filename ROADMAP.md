# 🛣️ Project Roadmap

Welcome to the official roadmap for the **Solana Counter Project**.
This document oulines the major milestones, upcoming improvements, and long-term vision for the project.

I aim to build a production-quality example that not only teaches **Solana + Anchor** best practices,
but also serves as a professional template for launching future decentralized applications (dApps).

## ✅ Completed (Milestone 1)

- [x] 🎯 Set up Solana counter program (`solana_counter`).
- [x] 🏗️ Create full CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
- [x] 🔐 Secure wallet management via GitHub Secrets.
- [x] 🔎 Linting, formatting, and Rust static analysis (Clippy).
- [x] 📖 Professional README, Changelog, and Mermaid diagrams.
- [x] 🛡️ MIT License added.
- [x] 🛠️ Validator helper scripts (`start-validator-native.sh`, etc.)
- [x] 🛠️ Badge integration: Build passing, License...
- [x] 📦 Cargo and Yarn dependency caching.

## 🛤️ Future Plans (Milestone 3+)

### 📈 Testing Enhancements

- [ ] 🧪 Matrix/grid testing: Solana versions x Rust versions x NOde.js versions.
- [ ] 🧪 expand test suite with error cases and failure recovery.

### 🏗️ Program Expansion

- [ ] 🎲 Write new Solana smart contracts:
  - Token mint example
  - Decentralized voting application
  - Escrow smart contract
  - Decentralized marketplace application

### 🌐 Frontend Development

- [ ] 🎨 Develop minimal React/Vite frontend UI.
- [ ] 🔗 Connect to local validator via web3.js.
- [ ] 🪪 Authenticate and show wallet info.
- [ ] 🖲️ Interact with smart contract functions via the frontend.

### 🌍 Deployment and Scaling

- [ ] 🚀 Prepare for realnet (devnet/mainnet) deployment.
- [ ] 🛡️ Implement security best practices (PDA seeds audit, validation)
